Use dashed lines for the predicted cursor movements
use shapes of same colour for each trajectory to indicate start and end
test model on other test datasets to form a probabilistic estimate of accuracy (error bars)
credit assignment problem - worth researching 
double check if you can perform the preprocessing of data in the closed loop
closed loop - essentially store the coefficients of the linear model in real time
# idea for an experiment - have two groups and give them different scenarios and tell them to different things 
normalise DOF by standard deviation as opposed to range
decode from derivatives of rigid body vectors
eliminate noise before differentiating - can use kalman filters or exponentially weighted moving average
use inkscape to make schematics
affinity designer is paid but is very good
photopea - can use it to improve design of plots after generating them in python
How is the experiment novel - how does the human behave when the closed loop control is being developed (initial stage)
can also look to decoupled moment balancing behaviour by asking participant to control using a controller initially then using closed loop control
